## Project 1
The English Club is a made up institue based in Graz, Austria which offers English lessons with special skills:
- Performing Arts
- Sports
- Coding
- Mixed-Media


# Site Structure

The site consists of three pages:
The [Home](https://scottcook1989.github.io/the-english-club/) page which is the first page you start on when you arrive at the site.
The next page is the [Courses](https://scottcook1989.github.io/the-english-club/courses.html) with information about courses on offer. The final page is the [Contact](https://scottcook1989.github.io/the-english-club/contact.html) page where users can send a message using the form.

Each page is accessible using the navigation at the top right of each page.

# Site Design

- Typography

For all of the text on the page, the font used is 'Verdana' which is a font that is not only very easy to read but works well on different devices and screen sizes.

As the same font was used for the who website, the text styles 'italic' and  was used.

- Colour

As the Union Jack flag is used across the pages, it was important to use those colours across the website.

-Blue - Hex 012169

Used for text colour.

-Red - Hex C8102E

Used for hover colour on the navigation and for the form on the contact page.

-White - Hex FFF

Used for the background colour.


# Site Use

The site is useful for users looking for ways of improving their English in Graz, Austria.

It supplies information about the courses on offer and also gives the user an opportunity to find out more by filling out a form that allows the user to write their own message.

# Site Features

- Logo and navigation bar:

[Logo and Navigation](../the-english-club/assets/docs/header.jpeg)

The logo and navigation bar are very simple and easy for the user to identify and use. The name of the pages are used in the navigation bar and the page the user is currently on is underlined.


- Hero Image

[Hero Image](../the-english-club/assets/docs/hero-image.jpeg)

The hero image is a vector image of the Union Jack flag. It is a consistant image found on every page.


- Video

[Video of Graz](../the-english-club/assets/docs/video.jpeg)

The video on the Home page shows many places to see in Graz, Austria. The video starts when the user presses play as autoplay can frustrate some users.


- Footer

[Footer](../the-english-club/assets/docs/footer.jpeg)

The footer consists of four social media icons that direct the user to that profile when clicked. The icons are very easy to recognise for any user.
